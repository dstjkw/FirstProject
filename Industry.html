                <br><br>
                <p1>The fashion industry is always looking for the latest trends to absorb, reimagine, and then renew relationships with the rest of the world in its own way.<br> This behavior is also common in web design. Thus, at the junction of the worlds of fashion and the Internet, sites appear that combine the latest <br> visual and technological trends.</p1>
                <br><br><br>
                <p2> Each fashion brand strives to create a unique and distinctive visual style that matches its personality. However, there are certain characteristics that are common <br> to the websites of most fashion companies. Most fashion sites rely on visuals to grab attention and let the products speak for themselves.
                    <br> The use of photographs is imperative, large title images and videos are very popular.In most cases, the home page consists of a large background photo and a navigation menu.
                    <br> The rest of the content is pushed into the background so it does not compete with the products displayed.</p2>
                    <br><br><br>
                <p3>Black and white is a common color scheme among trendy websites, especially those looking to convey an image of elegance and sophistication.<br> In contrast, young and playful brands prefer to use a lot more colors.</p3>
